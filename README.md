# Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures in Python.

## Data Structures Implemented

### 1. Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### 2. Queue
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### 3. Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.
