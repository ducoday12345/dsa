# Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains implementations of basic data structures in Python.

## Data Structures Implemented

### 1. Linked List
A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### 2. Queue
A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### 3. Stack
A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the top of the stack.

### 4. Hash Table
A Hash Table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. It allows for fast data retrieval through an index-like lookup, with the average time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations being O(1). Hash collisions are typically handled using chaining or open addressing.

### 5. Binary Search
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array. It repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element. If they match, the search ends; otherwise, the search continues in the appropriate half, with a time complexity of O(log n).
